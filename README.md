# rpi_audio_stream

A Raspberry Piâ€“based audio streaming system with a PC server and multiple Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH clients. The project enables music playback, white noise generation, and microphone priority handling, with communication over UDP.  

---

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project implements a server-client audio streaming system where:  
- **Server** runs on a PC, controlling playback, device management, and group messaging.  
- **Clients** are Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH devices equipped with audio hardware, capable of playing music, white noise, or microphone audio.  

Communication is handled over UDP, with support for broadcast and targeted messages.

## ðŸ“¡ Communication Protocol

**Goal:** Dynamic UDP-based communication between server and clients.  
- âœ… Protocol connections & callbacks implemented  
- ðŸ”„ Dynamic connection setup in real scenarios (**Ongoing**)  

---

## ðŸ›  Development Roadmap

### **Server & Client Development**  
- âœ… Implement core classes  
- âœ… Asynchronous handling of connections, inputs, outputs  
- âœ… Song selection for music playback  
- âœ… White noise treatment (*basic*)  
- ðŸ”„ Microphone priority handling  
- ðŸ”„ Real scenario connection setup (error handling & graceful reconnections)  
- ðŸ”„ Message routing to specific addresses or groups  

### **UI / Control Interface**  
- **Server UI** (Tkinter-based) â€“ *Ongoing*  
  - Control playback (3 buttons)  
  - Show button status  
  - Manage WiFi connection & status  
  - Display important system messages  
  - Select between broadcast or targeted messages  

### **RPi Environment Setup**  
- Install Raspberry Pi OS  
- Install & configure RPi client software  
  - Automate setup & initialization  
- Create installation binary for server (PC)  
- **Security consideration:** Evaluate cryptographic protection to prevent binary reverse engineering
